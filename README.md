# SmethBot

A discord bot with an extensive role management system and storage which allows you to manage a user's permissions individually rather than the typical limitation of clustering permissions by role. It also provides a cross server anonymous message service, and many other fun commands, such as changing your nickname and preventing you from changing it back for a period of time (taking advantage of the freedom provided by the permission management system).
